* Review terminology
  * Libraries vs frameworks
  * Functions vs methods
* Review language features
  * Inheritance
    * Extending a class
    * Implementing an interface
  * Anonymous classes
    * We made one in the BrowserAndroid project
    * They let you extend a class and instantiate it all at once

    * Create an AnonymousFunctionExample file
      * Run code in a separate method
      * Run code in a `Runnable`
      * Run code in an anonymous function
* HTTP
  * GET vs POST requests
* Create a web app
  * Create a new project and use the command line template
  * Project Structure -> Libraries -> Add [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/)
    * `com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.3`
  * Project Structure -> Modules -> New Folder...
    * Call it "resources" and mark it as such
  * Create `resources/public/index.html` and write the code to start it
  * Create a GET route
  * Difference between serving static files and creating routes
  * Project Structure -> Libraries -> Add the Mustache library
    * `com.sparkjava:spark-template-mustache:2.3`
  * Create `resources/templates/account.html`
  * Return the template in the GET route
  * Add create account form to `index.html`
  * Create a POST route that saves the username/password into an object
  * Display the name on the account page

### Day 2

* Review assignment (spark - microblog)
* Exercise (parse string, remove duplicate words, build new string)
* Add multi-user support to HelloSpark
  * Store users in `HashMap<String, User>`
  * Change the `/create-account` route to login as well
  * Change the `/accounts` route to use `users.values()`
  * Rename `accounts.html` to `logged-in.html`
  * Rename `index.html` to `not-logged-in.html` and move it into `resources/templates`
  * Remove the `/accounts` route
  * Create a `/` route that sends down either template based on whether the user is logged in or not
* Cookies
  * The `Session` works by storing a cookie with a session ID
  * Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a web server
  * Browsers send them back each time they talk to the server afterwards
* BeerTracker
  * Add the Spark and Mustache libraries
  * Create `resources/templates`
  * Create `resources/templates/logged-in.html`
  * Create `/` route
  * Create `resources/templates/not-logged-in.html`
  * Create `/login` route
  * Create `Beer` and the `/create-beer` route
  * Add beers to the `logged-in.html` template
  * Add an `id` to `Beer`
  * Create `/delete-beer` route and form

### Day 3

* Review assignment (spark - microblog continued)
* Exercise (with arraylist of names, take the first 5, map uppercase, filter those starting with "A")
* Streams
  * map
  * filter
* Forum
  * Set up the libraries and `resources` directory
  * Create `Message` (id, replyId, username and text) with a constructor
  * Create `User` (password and messages)
  * Create `HashMap<String, User>` and `ArrayList<Message>`
  * Write `addTestUsers` and `addTestMessages` method and make the aforementioned variables static
  * Create `threads.html`
    * Use the mustache if-else to determine whether to show the login form
    * Turn the thread text into links
  * Create `/` route
    * Get username from session
    * Create `HashMap` and add username/threads to it
  * Create `replies.html`
    * GET routes can receive parameters too, but they are passed via the URL rather than via an HTML form
    * Add permalinks so you can drill down reply threads
  * Create `/replies` route
    * Get username from session
    * Create `HashMap` and add username to it
    * Get id from `request.queryParams`
    * In try/catch, put the message and replies into the `HashMap`
  * Create login form in `threads.html`
  * Create `/login` route
    * Get username/password via `request.queryParams`
    * If either is empty, run `Spark.halt(403)`
    * Get `User` object for the given username
    * If null, create a new user object
    * If password isn't equal, run `Spark.halt(403)`
    * Add username to session
    * Redirect to `/`

### Day 4

* Review assignment (spark - paging)
* Review mustache
  * `String name;`
    * Welcome, {{name}}!
  * `ArrayList<String> names;`
    * {{#names}} {{.}} {{/names}}
  * `Message msg;`
    * {{#message}} {{text}} by {{username}} {{/message}}
  * `ArrayList<Message> messages;`
    * {{#messages}} {{text}} by {{username}} {{/messages}}
  * Conditional (truthy)
    * {{#name}}Welcome, {{name}}!{{/name}}
  * Conditional (falsey)
    * {{^name}}Please login.{{/name}}
* Exercise (reverse array, turn array into hashmap)
* Layers of the Internet
  * Physical layer (hardware)
    * Wireless
    * Electrical (ethernet, coaxial)
    * Fiber optics
  * Internet layer (packets)
    * IPv4
    * IPv6
  * Transport layer (reliability)
    * UDP (checksum)
    * TCP (checksum and retransmission)
  * Application layer (end users)
    * ASCII
    * UTF-8
    * HTTP
    * HTTP/2
* Forum
  * Create `header.html` to prevent duplication
  * Create create-message form in `header.html`
    * Use `<input type="hidden" name="replyId" value="{{replyId}}" />` to pass the reply id to the server
  * Create `/create-message` route
    * Get username from session
    * If username is null, run `Spark.halt(403)`
    * Get replyId and text from `request.queryParams`
    * In a try/catch, create `Message` and add it to the `ArrayList<Message>`
    * Redirect to `/`
  * You can make it refresh the current page rather than take you home
    * `response.redirect(request.headers("Referer"))`
* Build as a JAR file
  * File -> Project Structure...
  * Click "Artifacts" and then the plus button
  * JAR -> From modules with dependencies...
  * Choose the main class and click OK
  * Build -> Build Artifacts...
* Upload JAR file to the "Releases" section on Github
* CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
