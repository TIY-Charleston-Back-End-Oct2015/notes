### Introduction

This prework should be completed before class starts. You can do it over a weekend, or you can spread it out over a longer period of time if you prefer. Please don't rush yourself. Its purpose is to arm you with basic knowledge that you can hopefully gain independently of classroom instruction. The last section mentions a few things I'd like you to email me.

### Computer Setup

For the purposes of this prework, all you need is a browser; we generally use [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). For our class, we'll be using [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) for development. We'll be installing these things the day before class during the install party, but it's fine if you've already done so.

### Java

Java will be the main language we work with during the class. Being such a popular language, there are a lot of tutorials online, though many of them are varying degrees of crap. One that I've found fairly good is [Learn Java Online](http://www.learnjavaonline.org/). Please work through all the pages listed under "Learn the Basics".

### Clojure

Although we won't be using Clojure until later in the class, you'll be spending more time with it during this prework than Java. It's a pretty simple language, and will help us to start thinking like programmers. Please read through [Do Things: a Clojure Crash Course](http://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/).

Then, please [create an account on 4clojure](https://www.4clojure.com/register), a website with short programming problems to test your skills. Once you're logged in, look at their [problem list](https://www.4clojure.com/problems) and try to solve all the problems marked as "Elementary". Note that some of them may be difficult despite that designation. Try your best!

After that, watch [my talk about Clojure games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GzzFeS5cMc)!

### HTML & CSS

While not a focus of the course, we will need to do some front-end development when we get into web applications. Work through the [Codecademy course on HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) so you have a basic familiarity with them.

### Git

Working with Git will be a huge part of this class. Familiarity with it is going to be a requirement almost anywhere you end up working. Its purpose is to store "snapshots" (called commits) of your code, so you can see your progress and revert your changes if necessary. It also makes it easy to push your changes to a server, which acts as a backup of your code and a way to collaborate with other programmers.

Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account, as it is the most popular Git host and the one we'll be using throughout the class. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name. Then, work through [Try Github](https://try.github.io/), a short course on how to use Git.

### Deliverables

Please email zach@theironyard.com your 4clojure and Github usernames. Please take the opportunity to also tell me about any difficulties you think you'll encounter during the course.
